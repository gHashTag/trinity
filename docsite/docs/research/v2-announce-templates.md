### Post 1/5
```
We just released Trinity v2.1.0 — a fully local autonomous AI agent.

No cloud dependency. No API keys. Download, run, done.

Chat + code + vision + voice + tools + memory + self-reflection in one system.

Thread on what makes it different:
```

### Post 2/5
```
The core: Ternary Vector Symbolic Architecture (VSA).

Instead of float32, we compute with {-1, 0, +1}.
- 1.58 bits per trit (vs 32 bits per float)
- 20x memory savings
- Add-only math (no multiply needed)

JIT-compiled with ARM64 NEON SIMD: 28.10 M dot products/sec.
```

### Post 3/5
```
The AI stack (56 development cycles):

Layer 0: Ternary math
Layer 1: VSA engine + JIT SIMD
Layer 2: LLM inference (GGUF) + VIBEE compiler
Layer 3: Chat, code, RAG, voice, streaming, API
Layer 4: Multi-modal agents with memory + tools
Layer 5: Unified autonomous system with self-reflection

All integrated. All local.
```

### Post 4/5
```
What "autonomous" means here:

1. System auto-detects what you need (vision? code? voice?)
2. Decomposes your goal into sub-goals
3. Executes with appropriate tools
4. Reviews its own output
5. Learns from mistakes (pattern detection)
6. Tracks convergence toward phi^-1 threshold

No human in the loop required.
```

### Post 5/5
```

### Title
```
Trinity v2.1.0: Local autonomous multi-modal AI agent — ternary computing, JIT SIMD, 400 tests, no cloud
```

### Body
```
We released Trinity v2.1.0, an autonomous AI agent that runs entirely locally.

**What makes it different:**

Trinity uses ternary computing ({-1, 0, +1}) instead of floating point. This gives 20x memory savings over float32 and enables JIT-compiled NEON SIMD at 28.10 million dot products per second on ARM64.

**The autonomous system:**

Given any input, the system:
1. Auto-detects which capabilities are needed (vision, voice, code, text, tools, memory, reflection)
2. Decomposes the goal into sub-goals
3. Executes using multi-modal tool integration
4. Reviews its own output with self-reflection
5. Learns patterns from successes and failures
6. Tracks phi convergence for system health

**Stack:**
- Core: Vector Symbolic Architecture (VSA) with ternary encoding
- JIT: ARM64 NEON SIMD, x86_64 support
- LLM: GGUF model loading (works with TinyLlama, Llama, etc.)
- Compiler: VIBEE (.vibee specs → Zig/Verilog code generation)
- Built with Zig 0.15, statically linked, no dependencies

**Numbers:**
- 400 tests, zero failures
- 56 consecutive development cycles (all passing)
- 28.10 M ops/sec JIT dot product
- 15-18x speedup over scalar
- 4.2 MB full binary suite (macOS ARM64)

**Download:**
https://github.com/gHashTag/trinity/releases/tag/v2.1.0

**From source:**
```
git clone https://github.com/gHashTag/trinity
cd trinity && zig build test  # 400/400
```

Happy to answer questions about the ternary approach or the autonomous agent architecture.

## Hacker News

### Title
```
Show HN: Trinity v2.1.0 – Local autonomous AI agent using ternary computing (Zig)
```

### Body
```
Trinity is a local-first AI system built on ternary computing ({-1, 0, +1}) using Vector Symbolic Architecture (VSA).

Key technical points:

1. Ternary encoding: 1.58 bits/trit vs 32 bits/float. 20x memory savings. Compute uses addition only (no multiplication needed for dot products in ternary).

2. JIT compilation: ARM64 NEON SIMD with SDOT instruction processes 16 int8 elements per cycle. Measured at 28.10M dot products/sec on Apple Silicon. 15-18x over scalar.

3. Autonomous agent: 8-phase pipeline — auto-detect capabilities from natural language, decompose goals, execute with tools, self-reflect, learn patterns. Tracks convergence using phi^-1 (0.618) as the health threshold.

4. VIBEE compiler: YAML-based spec format generates Zig or Verilog code. One spec → multiple targets.

5. 400 tests, 56 development cycles, all passing.

Built with Zig 0.15. Statically linked. No runtime dependencies.
