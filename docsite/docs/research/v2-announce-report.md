## Critical Assessment

**What went well:**
- Templates cover all major platforms with platform-appropriate tone
- Technical accuracy maintained — real numbers, real benchmarks
- Clear install instructions in every template
- X thread format breaks down complex system into digestible parts

**What could be improved:**
- No demo video yet — would significantly boost engagement
- No GIF/screenshot assets — visual content gets 2-3x engagement on X/Reddit
- No blog post on dev.to or Medium for long-form SEO
- Should create a simple landing page with "Download" button

**Recommended additions:**
- 30-second terminal demo GIF showing: install → run → chat interaction
- Architecture diagram as PNG for social sharing
- Comparison benchmark chart (Trinity vs typical float32 systems)
- Dev.to or Hashnode blog post for SEO reach
