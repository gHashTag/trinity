# Trinity S³AI / t27 — Repository constitution

**Status:** Active  
**Version:** 1.2  
**Date:** 2026-04-06  

---



## Preamble

The Trinity S³AI repository is built around the **t27** specification language and the **`tri`** toolchain (`./scripts/tri` forwards to the Rust `t27c` bootstrap binary). Mathematics, numerics, and physics formulas that participate in verification must not be split between “the spec” and “side scripts.” First-party documentation under **`docs/`** follows a **single, published tree** so contributors and agents do not accumulate ad-hoc files at the wrong depth. The following articles establish these norms.

---

## Article SSOT-MATH — single source of truth for mathematics and physics

**Article SSOT-MATH.** The mathematical, numeric, and physical meaning of Trinity S³AI / t27 has **one normative source of truth**: specifications in the **t27** language (`*.t27` files), exercised through the official **`tri`** pipeline and tied to **`.trinity/experience/`** artifacts where run experience is recorded.

It is **forbidden** to introduce new **Python** dependencies (or equivalent script bypasses) on the **critical path** of verification, conformance, or “verdict,” except for **explicitly marked legacy** code with a removal date and a tracked migration into `.t27`.

Target backends (**Zig, C, Verilog**) are **compiler output**, not hand-written application languages; hand-written Zig outside the generated pipeline is allowed only in **bootstrap** (compiler implementation) and related build infrastructure.

The numeric formalism relies on repository standards (**NUMERIC-STANDARD-001**, GoldenFloat, Strand I in `specs/math/sacred_physics.t27` and related specs). Extensions for precision or new numeric primitives are delivered through the **t27 language and compiler**, not external interpreters.

---

## Article LANG-EN — English for first-party code and documentation

**Article LANG-EN.** All **first-party** Markdown under `docs/`, `specs/`, `architecture/`, `clara-bridge/`, `conformance/`, and root project Markdown (`README.md`, `AGENTS.md`, `CLAUDE.md`, `TASK.md`, `SOUL.md`) **MUST** be written in **English**. Source files (`.t27`, `.zig`, etc.) **MUST** use **English** for comments and identifiers, and remain **ASCII-only** per **ADR-004** and root **`SOUL.md`** Article I (expanded detail in **`docs/nona-03-manifest/SOUL.md`** Law #1).

Grandfathered non-English paths are listed only in **`docs/.legacy-non-english-docs`** until translated; **do not expand** that list without Architect approval. Vendored content under **`external/`** is exempt.

**Enforcement:** (1) **`cargo build` / `cargo build --release` in `bootstrap/`** — `build.rs` fails the build with a cited error; (2) **`scripts/check-first-party-doc-language.sh`** in CI (Python checker).

---

## Article DOCS-TREE — single layout for `docs/`

**Article DOCS-TREE.** First-party Markdown under **`docs/`** **MUST** follow the **three-nona / 27-agent** layout indexed in **`docs/README.md`**. That README is the **authoritative map** of the tree; any **structural** change (new top-level subdirectory under **`docs/`**, or redefinition of what belongs in each nona) **MUST** land together with an update to **`docs/README.md`** and, if policy changes, a bump of this charter.

**1. Root of `docs/` (anchors only).** Aside from **`docs/.legacy-non-english-docs`**, only these files **MAY** reside **directly** in **`docs/`**: **`NOW.md`**, **`T27-CONSTITUTION.md`**, **`OWNERS.md`**, and **`README.md`** (the index). **No** other new **`*.md`** **SHALL** be added at **`docs/*.md`** except by amending this article.

**2. Required buckets.** Every other new first-party **`*.md`** under **`docs/`** **MUST** live under exactly one of:

| Path | Role |
|------|------|
| **`docs/agents/`** | 27-agent alphabet canon and expanded agent behavior text. |
| **`docs/coordination/`** | TASK protocol, inter-agent handoff, portable bundles. |
| **`docs/nona-01-foundation/`** | Foundation themes (alphabet nona **A–I**): rings, brain charter, language purge, sandbox, architecture-adjacent charter. |
| **`docs/nona-02-organism/`** | Organism themes (nona **J–R**): language spec, numerics, physics, critical-path TZs; **thematic subfolders** (e.g. **`physics-kepler/`**) **SHOULD** be used when **three or more** closely related documents would otherwise clutter one directory. |
| **`docs/nona-03-manifest/`** | Manifest themes (nona **S–Ϯ**): TDD, CI/testing policy, PHI loop, strategy, claims, expanded **`SOUL`** reference (root **`SOUL.md`** remains canonical). |
| **`docs/clara/`** | CLARA / submission / evidence / composition pack. |

**3. Forbidden patterns.** **Do not** create **`docs/misc/`**, **`docs/tmp/`**, **`docs/old/`**, or other informal dumping grounds without **Architect** approval, an update to **`docs/README.md`**, and an amendment here. **Do not** duplicate normative **`*.t27`** behavior as shadow specs in **`docs/`**; **`specs/`** is the product SSOT for executable spec text (**Article SSOT-MATH**).

**4. Placement rule.** If placement is unclear, use **`docs/agents/AGENTS_ALPHABET.md`** domain column; prefer **`docs/nona-03-manifest/`** for cross-cutting governance and **`docs/coordination/`** for task routing and human handoff.

**5. Other top-level trees.** **`specs/`**, **`architecture/`**, **`conformance/`**, **`clara-bridge/`**, **`bootstrap/`** keep their own **`OWNERS.md`** and purpose; this article governs **`docs/`** only.

**Enforcement:** **Code review** and **Issue Gate**; optional CI path checks may be added later. **OWNERS** for **`docs/`** is **`docs/OWNERS.md`**.


## § 2 — Invariant Laws (never change without constitutional amendment)

These seven laws are the **constitutional bedrock** of Trinity S³AI / t27. They govern behavior, not formats or scientific claims. Amendments require explicit consensus and version bump.

### Law Table (L1–L7)

| Law # | Name | Body | Enforcement |
|-------|------|------|-------------|
| **L1** | **TRACEABILITY** | No code merged without `Closes #N` — every PR must reference a GitHub issue | `.github/workflows/issue-gate.yml` |
| **L2** | **GENERATION** | Files under `gen/` are generated; edit the `.t27` spec instead | `./target/release/t27c validate-gen-headers` |
| **L3** | **PURITY** | All `.t27` / `.zig` / `.v` / `.c` source — ASCII-only identifiers & comments | `SOUL.md`, `ADR-004`, build.rs language checks |
| **L4** | **TESTABILITY** | Every `.t27` spec must contain `test` / `invariant` / `bench` | Ring 037 / #132, parser enforcement |
| **L5** | **IDENTITY** | **K2 core:** φ² = φ + 1 on ℝ; consequence φ² + φ⁻² = 3; IEEE f64 checks use tolerance | `NUMERIC-CORE-PALETTE-REGISTRY.md`, `specs/math/constants.t27` |
| **L6** | **CEILING** | `conformance/FORMAT-SPEC-001.json` + `specs/numeric/gf16.t27` are the numeric ceiling — never forked | SSOT: seal coverage CI |
| **L7** | **UNITY** | No new `*.sh` on the critical path for validation / gen / data | `SOUL.md` Article VIII; `t27c` + `tri` only |

### Alias Index (legacy → L1–L7)

| Legacy name | New name |
|-------------|----------|
| ISSUE-GATE | L1 TRACEABILITY |
| NO-HAND-EDIT-GEN | L2 GENERATION |
| SOUL-ASCII | L3 PURITY |
| TDD-MANDATE | L4 TESTABILITY |
| PHI-IDENTITY | L5 IDENTITY |
| TRINITY-SACRED | L6 CEILING |
| NO-NEW-SHELL | L7 UNITY |

### Law Priority

Laws follow **Asimov-style priority** (L1 > L2 > … > L7):

1. **L1 TRACEABILITY** (highest) — Without issue linkage, nothing enters the repository
2. **L2 GENERATION** — Generated files are output, not source
3. **L3 PURITY** — Language policy enables universal tooling
4. **L4 TESTABILITY** — TDD ensures specifications are verifiable
5. **L5 IDENTITY** — Mathematical truth (φ) has specific tolerance requirements
6. **L6 CEILING** — Numeric formats are SSOT; never forked
7. **L7 UNITY** — Toolchain consolidation via `tri` / `t27c`

In conflict scenarios, the higher-priority law prevails.
