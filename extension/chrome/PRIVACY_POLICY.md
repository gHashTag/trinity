## Overview

Firebird Anti-Detect ("Firebird", "we", "our", "the extension") is a browser extension that protects your privacy by modifying browser fingerprints. This privacy policy explains how we handle your data.

## Data Collection

### What We DO NOT Collect

Firebird does **NOT** collect, store, transmit, or share:

- Personal information (name, email, address)
- Browsing history or visited URLs
- Cookies or session data
- Form data or passwords
- IP addresses
- Device identifiers
- Any data that leaves your browser

### What We Store Locally

Firebird stores the following data **only on your device** using Chrome's local storage API:

- **Extension settings**: Your protection preferences (canvas, WebGL, audio toggles)
- **Fingerprint seed**: A random number used to generate consistent fingerprint modifications
- **Similarity score**: A number indicating fingerprint evolution progress

This data:
- Never leaves your device
- Is not transmitted to any server
- Is not shared with third parties
- Can be deleted by uninstalling the extension

## How Firebird Works

1. **Local Processing**: All fingerprint modifications happen entirely in your browser
2. **No Network Requests**: Firebird makes zero network requests to external servers
3. **No Analytics**: We do not use any analytics, tracking, or telemetry
4. **No Accounts**: No registration or login required

## Permissions Explained

| Permission | Purpose |
|------------|---------|
| `storage` | Save your settings locally |
| `activeTab` | Apply protection to current tab |
| `scripting` | Inject fingerprint protection code |
| `<all_urls>` | Protect you on all websites |

## Third-Party Services

Firebird does **NOT** use any third-party services, APIs, or SDKs.

## Data Security

- All data remains on your device
- No encryption needed as no data is transmitted
- Chrome's built-in storage security applies

## Children's Privacy

Firebird does not knowingly collect data from anyone, including children under 13.
