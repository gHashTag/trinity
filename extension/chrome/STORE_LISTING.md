## Detailed Description

### NeoDetect Anti-Detect

Protect your online privacy with WASM-powered fingerprint protection and cross-platform emulation.

**What is Browser Fingerprinting?**
Websites can identify you by collecting unique characteristics of your browser - canvas rendering, WebGL parameters, audio processing, and more. Even without cookies, you can be tracked across the web.

**How NeoDetect Protects You**
NeoDetect uses a high-performance WASM engine compiled from Zig to generate deterministic fingerprints, allowing you to appear as different users across different operating systems and hardware configurations.

**Core Protections:**
✅ Canvas fingerprint - Adds ternary noise to canvas operations
✅ WebGL protection - Spoofs GPU vendor and renderer
✅ Audio fingerprint - Injects noise into audio context
✅ Navigator spoofing - Spoofs platform, userAgent, hardware info
✅ WebRTC IP leak - Filters local IP addresses
✅ Battery API - Returns spoofed battery status
✅ Client Hints - Spoofs User-Agent Client Hints

**OS Emulation:**
• Windows 10/11
• macOS Sonoma
• Linux Ubuntu

**Hardware Emulation:**
• Intel i5/i7/i9
• AMD Ryzen 5/7/9
• Apple M1/M2/M3

**GPU Emulation:**
• NVIDIA RTX 3060/4070/4090
• AMD RX 6700/7900
• Intel UHD 770
• Apple M1/M2/M3 GPU

**Profile Management:**
• Save/load multiple browser profiles
• Import/export profiles as JSON
• Deterministic fingerprint recreation from seed
• Presets: Paranoid, Balanced, Minimal

**Privacy First:**
🔒 Zero data collection - Everything stays on your device
🔒 No accounts required - Just install and protect
🔒 No network requests - Works completely offline
🔒 Open source - Verify our code on GitHub

**Technical Innovation:**
• WASM engine compiled from Zig for maximum performance
