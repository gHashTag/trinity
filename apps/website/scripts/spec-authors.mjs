// WHO WROTE THE SPECS - the only contribution this project is actually about.
//
//   GH_TOKEN=$(gh auth token) node scripts/spec-authors.mjs > public/roadmap/spec-authors.json
//
// WHY THIS REPLACED A COMMIT COUNT. The PEOPLE board first read GitHub's
// `/contributors` endpoint, which answers "who has commits in this repository"
// - and BrowserOS is a fork, so its top contributor by that measure had 1,335
// commits and has never touched a `.t27` file. Owner's word, 2026-09-23: only
// the people who made the specs belong here.
//
// WHAT IS COUNTED, EXACTLY: commits that touch a directory holding `.t27`
// files, in every public gHashTag repository that has any, by GitHub account.
// Not every file under those directories is a spec, and a commit is not a file
// - so this is a measure of work ON the corpus, and the JSON says so in its own
// `method` field rather than leaving a reader to assume something finer.
//
// WHY THE SOURCES ARE DISCOVERED, NOT LISTED. Until 2026-10-02 this file named
// four repositories by hand. The specs had spread to eighteen, so everyone who
// wrote theirs in tri-net, trinity-fpga, trios, tri-claw or the tt-trinity
// chips was missing from the board. Owner's word, 2026-10-02: "why are not all
// spec creators on the leaderboard?" The list is now read from GitHub on every
// run: each public repository's tree, every directory with a `.t27` in it.
//
// A ROW IS A GITHUB ACCOUNT, NOTHING ELSE. Owner's word, 2026-10-02: rank by
// GitHub account names; "Claude Code (agent)" is not a GitHub account. A commit
// whose email GitHub cannot tie to an account - the swarm committing as
// "Trinity Bee", an agent committing as `claude@anthropic.com` - is credited to
// the account that opened the merged pull request carrying it, because that is
// the person who asked for the work and answered for it in review. See
// `attribute` below for the full order. What still has no account is counted
// as a number, not drawn as a person.
//
// WHY A FILE AND NOT A LIVE READ: an honest answer needs hundreds of GitHub
// requests and anonymous GitHub allows sixty an hour per address. A generated
// file costs the visitor nothing and cannot be rate-limited.
//
// It never clones anything: a first version of the stack count did, and filled
// the disk of the machine it was measuring from.
