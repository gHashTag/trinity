Three traps in this flow are worth knowing: synth_xilinx takes -family xc7, not -arch; prjxray fasm2frames must run in-tree with PYTHONPATH set, because it is usually not pip-installed; and --db-root is the family directory, never the part directory. One more cost real time: a failed fasm2frames still leaves a partial .frames, from which xc7frames2bit will happily build a normal-looking 9.7 MB bitstream that flashes with done=1 and leaves the board silent. Check the exit status, not the file size — and done=1 means configuration completed, not that your design is on the board.',
