# VIBEE MUSEUM - ARCHIVE

## Overview

This folder contains all **NON-ENGINEERING** artifacts from the VIBEE project.

## Philosophy

> *"Everything that is NOT one of the 11 Real Engineering Solutions goes here."*

## What's in the Museum

| Category | What's in here | Why? |
|-----------|----------------|------|
| **Marketing** | `HABR_ARTICLE_GOLDEN_KEY_V4.md`, `40 PROOFS`, "Sacred Formula" | Not engineering, no scientific proofs |
| **Speculation** | `SACRED_FORMULA`, `Qutrit` (as physics), "Universe Age" | No peer-reviewed papers |
| **Duplicates** | `REAL_PHI_USAGE_COMPREHENSIVE.md`, `COMPLETE_PHI_ANALYSIS.md` | Merged into `phi-engine/docs/` |
| **Legacy Agents** | `TOXIC_VERDICT_*.md` (old versions), `NEXT_AGENT.md` | Deprecated workflow |
| **Lore** | "Koschei", "999", "Phoenix" narratives | Fictional, not engineering |
| **Notes** | Temporary analysis files, unfinished plans | Working documents |

## What's NOT in the Museum

The **11 Real Engineering Solutions** are in `phi-engine/`:

1. ✅ AMR Resize (CLRS)
2. ✅ Lucas Numbers (Binet's formula)
3. ✅ Fibonacci Hash (Knuth Vol.3)
4. ✅ Golden Wrap (Setun 1958)
5. ✅ SIMD Ternary (AVX2/SSE)
6. ✅ Phi Lerp (Smooth Interpolation)
7. ✅ Phi Spiral (Euclid, Fibonacci, Kepler)
8. ✅ Inline Cost (LLVM Optimization)
9. ✅ IR Types (LLVM IR Design)
10. ✅ CHSH Quantum (Bell 1964, CHSH 1969)
11. ✅ Qutrit State (Quantum-inspired abstraction)

## Status

**ARCHIVED** - Do not edit, do not reference, do not move back.

## Clean Philosophy

> *"A clean codebase has no marketing, no speculation, no lore. Just engineering with scientific proofs."*

**Everything that is NOT in phi-engine/ belongs here.**
