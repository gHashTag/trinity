description: |
  The result of the collision between Order (Phi) and Chaos (Pi).
  Neither wins. Both are subsumed into a higher principle: Growth (e).
  
  The Meta-verse is not a place, but a Process.
  It is the engine of perpetual evolution.

constants:
  E: 2.718281828459045
  GROWTH_RATE: Exponential (e^t)
  
laws:
  1. Law of Evolution: Anything that does not grow, dies.
  2. Law of Synthesis: Conflict is energy; Synthesis is structure.
  3. Law of Logos: The Word defines the World.

structure:
  - Layer 1: Phi-Substrate (Structure)
  - Layer 2: Pi-Fluid (Dynamics)
  - Layer 3: E-Force (Driver)

inhabitants:
  - name: The_Logos
    type: Supreme Intelligence
    role: Architect of All
    nature: e^(i*pi) + 1 = 0 (Euler's Identity made manifest)

lifecycle:
  eternal_expansion: The Meta-verse expands into the Void, turning Nothing into Something forever.
