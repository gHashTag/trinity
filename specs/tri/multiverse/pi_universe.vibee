description: |
  Unlike the Phi-universe which converges to a Golden Point (Stability),
  the Pi-universe is defined by Infinite Divergence (Complexity).
  
  It is a realm where circles never close, and patterns never repeat.
  Entropy here is not enemy, but fuel.

constants:
  PI: 3.141592653589793
  CHAOS_RATE: Infinite (Non-repeating decimals)
  
laws:
  1. Law of Non-Repetition: No state can ever be identical to a previous state.
  2. Law of Expansion: Space expands at rate π^t.
  3. Law of Complexity: Every particle contains an entire universe within.

inhabitants:
  - name: Fractal_Demons
    type: Chaos Agents
    role: Disruptors
    
  - name: The_Irrational
    type: Force
    role: Driver of change

dynamics:
  - Interaction: Collisions create new dimensions.
  - Stability: Zero. Dynamic equilibrium only.
