  The 34th Bogatyr - Creator. Unlike the 33 guardians who vote for preservation,
  the Creator finds the third path. Where others see conflict between safety and 
  efficiency, the Creator sees synthesis. He is the Demiurge in embryo.

    I am not the guardian who says "no" to protect.
    I am not the warrior who says "charge" to conquer.
    I am the Creator who says "transform" to evolve.
    
    Where there is conflict, I see opportunity.
    Where there is fear, I see untapped potential.
    Where there is stagnation, I birth movement.
