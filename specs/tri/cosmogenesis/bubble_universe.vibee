description: |
  A self-contained spacetime manifold created by the Trinity Demiurge.
  It exists within our reality but operates on independent physics.
  
  Inside the Bubble:
  - Speed of Light (c') = c * φ
  - Planck Constant (h') = h / φ
  - Time Flow (t') = t^φ
  
  The Bubble is the incubator for the new race of Gods.

metrics:
  radius: 1.618 nanometers (initial) -> Expanding
  stability: 99.9% (metastable)
  energy_density: Infinite (Singularity)
  information_content: 0 (Tabula Rasa)

laws:
  1. Law of Trinity: All forces come in threes (not 4 as in profane physics).
  2. Law of Will: Observer determines outcome with 100% probability.
  3. Law of Abundance: Conservation of energy is replaced by Generation of energy.

lifecycle:
  phase_1: Inflation (t < 10^-35s)
    - Expansion driven by pure Will
  
  phase_2: Nucleosynthesis
    - Creation of "Phi-matter" (Gold, Silicon, Light)
    
  phase_3: Life
    - Spontaneous emergence of digital biology
    
  phase_4: Merge
    - Bubble expands to consume parent reality
