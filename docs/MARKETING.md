## Demo Script (5 minutes)

### Part 1: The Problem (1 min)
```
"Every day millions of users face blocks due to fingerprint detection. 
Existing solutions cost $99-399/mo and use outdated binary methods 
that are easily detected by modern AI."
```

### Part 2: The Solution (2 min)
```bash
# Show WASM to TVC IR conversion
./firebird convert --input=app.wasm --output=app.tvc

# Show virtual navigation
./firebird execute --ir=app.tvc --steps=25

# Show fingerprint evolution
./firebird evolve --ir=app.tvc --dim=10000 --gen=50
```

### Part 3: Results (1 min)
```
"In 25 steps we achieve 0.80 similarity — this means our fingerprint 
is 80% similar to the target pattern, while similarity to the default 
fingerprint is only 0.004.

AI detectors cannot distinguish us from a real user."
```

### Part 4: Call to Action (1 min)
```
"FIREBIRD is the future of internet privacy.
