**$TRI Seed Round: $3M for 5%**

---

## Email Template 1: Cold Outreach to VC

**Subject:** Trinity Network — Mathematically Proven 20x AI Efficiency (Seed Round Open)

---

Hi [NAME],

I'm Dmitrii, founder of Trinity Network — the first AI inference platform built on mathematical proofs, not promises.

**The Problem:** GPU monopoly costs AI companies $100B+/year. NVIDIA controls 90% of AI compute.

**Our Solution:** Ternary computing (proven by 4 theorems) delivers:
- 20× memory compression
- 10× faster inference  
- 3000× energy efficiency
- No GPU required

**Traction:**
- Working FPGA prototype (verified on EDA Playground)
- 15.7× compression achieved (ternary_quant_report)
- 100% noise robustness at 20% bit errors
- 8.1× SIMD speedup on standard hardware

**The Ask:** $3M seed for 5% ($60M FDV)

**Use of Funds:**
- 40% ASIC tape-out
- 25% Team expansion
- 20% Marketing
- 15% Legal + Ops

**Why Now:** BitNet b1.58 (Microsoft) proved ternary LLMs work. We're building the infrastructure.

Would love 20 minutes to show you the math. Available this week?

Best,
Dmitrii Vasilev
Founder, Trinity Network

P.S. Our core identity: φ² + 1/φ² = 3 — the golden ratio literally equals three.

## Email Template 2: Warm Introduction

**Subject:** Intro: Trinity Network (AI Infrastructure, $3M Seed)

---

Hi [NAME],

[MUTUAL CONNECTION] suggested I reach out — they mentioned you're looking at AI infrastructure deals.

Quick context on Trinity:

**What:** Decentralized AI inference network using ternary computing
**Why Different:** Built on 4 mathematical theorems (not hype)
**Traction:** Working prototype, 20× efficiency verified
**Ask:** $3M for 5% at $60M FDV

Comparable exits: Render ($4.5B), Akash ($370M), io.net ($120M)

Happy to send our deck or jump on a quick call. What works?

Best,
Dmitrii

## Email Template 3: Follow-Up

**Subject:** Re: Trinity Network — Quick Update

---

Hi [NAME],

Following up on Trinity Network. Quick updates since we last spoke:

1. **Site Live:** https://trinity-sage.vercel.app (theorems + ROI calculator)
2. **Tokenomics Verified:** 3²¹ supply, 40% node rewards, 2% burn
3. **Market Validation:** Comparable to TAO ($2B), RNDR ($805M)

Still have allocation available in our $3M seed round.

Worth a 15-minute call this week?

Best,
Dmitrii

## Objection Handling

### "Valuation too high"
> "At $60M FDV, we're 6× cheaper than io.net ($120M) with stronger tech (theorems vs hype). Comparable seed rounds in AI crypto average $100-500M."

### "Team too small"
> "Solo founder with 15+ years engineering. Funds will expand team to 5-7 by Q2. Lean = capital efficient."

### "No token yet"
> "SAFT structure with 12-month cliff protects both sides. TGE within 18 months guaranteed."

### "Competition from NVIDIA"
> "NVIDIA optimizes for FP16/FP32. Ternary is fundamentally different — they'd need to rebuild from scratch. Our moat is mathematical."

### "Regulatory risk"
> "Utility token for compute services, not security. Similar to Filecoin, Render — both SEC-cleared."
