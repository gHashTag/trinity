## 8. MATHEMATICAL FOUNDATION

Trinity Network is built on 4 proven mathematical theorems:

### Theorem 1: Optimal Radix
```
I(r) = (B/r) × log₂(r)
Maximum at r = e ≈ 2.718
Nearest integer: 3 (ternary)
Efficiency: 94.9% of theoretical maximum
```

### Theorem 2: Trinity Identity
```
φ² + 1/φ² = 3
Golden ratio encodes ternary optimality
```

### Theorem 3: Ternary Quantization
```
log₂(3) = 1.585 bits
20× memory compression vs float32
```

### Theorem 4: Radix Economy
```
E(3) = 2.731 < E(2) = 2.885 < E(4) = 3.000
Ternary is optimal among integers
```
